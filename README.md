How to compile a Chrome theme/app
============

<br>Bring up the Extensions management page by going to this URL:
chrome://extensions</br>
<br>Ensure that the "Developer mode" checkbox in the top right-hand corner is checked.</br>
<br>Click the Pack extension button. A dialog appears.</br>
<br>In the Extension root directory field, specify the path to the extension's folderâ€”for example, C:\myext. (Ignore the other field; you don't specify a private key file the first time you package a particular extension.)</br>
<br>Click Package. The packager creates two files: a .crx file, which is the actual extension that can be installed, and a .pem file, which contains the private key.</br>
