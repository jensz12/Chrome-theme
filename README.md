<h1>How to compile a Chrome theme/app</h1>

* Bring up the Extensions management page by going to this URL:
chrome://extension.
* Ensure that the "Developer mode" checkbox in the top right-hand corner is checked.
* Click the Pack extension button. A dialog appears.
* In the Extension root directory field, specify the path to the extension's folderâ€”for example, C:\myext. (Ignore the other field; you don't specify a private key file the first time you package a particular extension.)
* Click Package. The packager creates two files: a .crx file, which is the actual extension that can be installed, and a .pem file, which contains the private key.
